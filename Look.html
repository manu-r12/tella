    <h3><strong>About Earth📘</strong></h3>
    <p>The history of Earth covers approximately 4 billion years (4,567,000,000 years), from Earth’s formation out of the solar nebula to the present.
        Earth formed as part of the birth of the solar system: what eventually became the solar system initially existed as a large, rotating cloud of dust and gas.
        It was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements produced by stars long gone.</p>
